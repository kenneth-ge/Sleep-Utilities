# Sleep-Utilities
Do you also have trouble catching zzz's? Then maybe this repository is for you! This is where I put things I've made with code that help me sleep better at night. 

## Lower Volume at Night
I like to put white noise on with my laptop (wearing headphones to bed), but I don't want to be exposed to loud noises for too long. Even though I try to keep the volume levels safe, just in case, I've made a scheduled Windows task to lower the volume down to super safe levels at 2 AM, when hopefully I'm asleep. 

## Repeat Song X Times
I wrote a lullaby for myself so I can fall asleep listening to it! I like to repeat it multiple times so I have enough time to calm down. However, I don't want to be listening to it *too* many times -- I still want time to listen to rain/white noise and drift to sleep. Also, I would hate to wake up in the morning and have the lullaby still be playing at full volume. So, I wrote this simple website (with dark mode :D) to play a local audio file a certain X number of times.
